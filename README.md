# My Personal Website

I wanted to redo my site from the ground up since I learned more about how to properly structure HTML and learned some more about JavaScript and CSS.
The style seemed outdated to me as well, so I wanted to update it to a different look.

My old site had some cool styling to it, so I still wanted to preserve it into its own repo for the time being as reference.
